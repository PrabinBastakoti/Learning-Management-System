## Reflection

This was a 7 week long project built during my sixth Semester at Balkumari College (Tribhuvan University). Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to browse different learning topics based on what they were involved in, such as 'Bsc.Csit, BCA, BHM'. I started this process by using the `flask`.  

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a few days on a research.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are Python, Flask, Jinja and a significant amount of HTML, and CSS.
